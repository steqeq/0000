***********************************************************
What is ROCm?
***********************************************************

ROCm is an open-source stack, composed primarily of open-source software, designed for
graphics processing unit (GPU) computation. ROCm consists of a collection of drivers, development
tools, and APIs that enable GPU programming from low-level kernel to end-user applications.

ROCm is powered by
`Heterogeneous-computing Interface for Portability (HIP) <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/index.html>`_;
it supports programming models, such as OpenMP and OpenCL, and includes all necessary open
source software compilers, debuggers, and libraries. It's fully integrated into machine learning (ML)
frameworks, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow.

.. tip::
  If you're using Radeon GPUs, refer to the
  :doc:`Radeon-specific ROCm documentation <radeon:index>`.
