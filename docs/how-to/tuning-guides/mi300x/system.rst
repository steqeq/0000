AMD Instinct MI300X system optimization
***************************************

The :doc:`/how-to/system-optimization/mi300x` guide discusses system settings that are
required to configure your system for AMD Instinct™ MI300X accelerators.
Some settings discussed are known to improve performance for most applications
running on an MI300X system.

Topics discussed therein include:

* :ref:`System BIOS settings <mi300x-bios-settings>`

* :ref:`GRUB settings <mi300x-grub-settings>`

* :ref:`Operating system settings <mi300x-os-settings>`

* :ref:`System management <mi300x-system-management>`
