********************************************************************************
Graph-safe support for ROCm libraries
********************************************************************************

HIP graph-safe libraries operate safely in HIP execution graphs.
:ref:`hip:how_to_HIP_graph` are an alternative way of executing tasks on a GPU
that can provide performance benefits over launching kernels using the standard
method via streams.

Functions and routines from graph-safe libraries shouldn’t result in issues like
race conditions, deadlocks, or unintended dependencies.

The following table shows whether a ROCm library is graph-safe.
