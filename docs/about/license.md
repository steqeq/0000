Open sourced ROCm components are released via public GitHub
repositories, packages on [https://repo.radeon.com](https://repo.radeon.com) and other distribution channels.
Proprietary products are only available on [https://repo.radeon.com](https://repo.radeon.com). Currently, only
one component of ROCm, `rocm-llvm-alt` is governed by a proprietary license.
Proprietary components are organized in a proprietary subdirectory in the package
repositories to distinguish from open sourced packages.
