ROCm™ 6.1.1 introduces minor fixes and improvements to some tools and libraries.

### OS support

ROCm 6.1.1 has been tested against a pre-release version of Ubuntu 22.04.5 (kernel: 5.15 [GA], 6.8 [HWE]).

### AMD SMI

AMD SMI for ROCm 6.1.1

#### Additions

* Added deferred error correctable counts to `amd-smi metric -ecc -ecc-blocks`.

#### Changes

* Updated the output of `amd-smi metric --clock` to reflect each engine.
* Updated the output of `amd-smi topology --json` to align with output reported by host and guest systems.

#### Fixes

* Fixed `amd-smi metric --clock`'s clock lock status and deep sleep status.
* Fixed an issue that would cause an error when attempting to reset non-AMD GPUs.
* Fixed `amd-smi metric --pcie` and `amdsmi_get_pcie_info()` when using RDNA3 (Navi 32 and Navi 31) hardware to prevent "UNKNOWN" reports.
* Fixed the output results of `amd-smi process` when getting processes running on a device.

#### Known issues

* `amd-smi bad-pages` can result in a `ValueError: Null pointer access` error when using certain PMU firmware versions.

### HIPCC

HIPCC for ROCm 6.1.1

#### Changes

* **Upcoming:** a future release will enable use of compiled binaries `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` by default. No action is needed by users; you may continue calling high-level Perl scripts `hipcc` and `hipconfig`. `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` will be invoked by the high-level Perl scripts. To revert to the previous behavior and invoke `hipcc.pl` and `hipconfig.pl`, set the `HIP_USE_PERL_SCRIPTS` environment variable to `1`.
* **Upcoming:** a subsequent release will remove high-level Perl scripts `hipcc` and `hipconfig`. This release will remove the `HIP_USE_PERL_SCRIPTS` environment variable. It will rename `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` to `hipcc` and `hipconfig` respectively. No action is needed by the users. To revert to the previous behavior, invoke `hipcc.pl` and `hipconfig.pl` explicitly.
* **Upcoming:** a subsequent release will remove `hipcc.pl` and `hipconfig.pl`.

### ROCm SMI

ROCm SMI for ROCm 6.1.1

#### Known issues

* ROCm SMI reports GPU utilization incorrectly for RDNA3 GPUs in some situations. See the issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/3112).
