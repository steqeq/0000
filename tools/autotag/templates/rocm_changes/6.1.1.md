ROCm™ 6.1.1 introduces minor fixes and improvements to some tools and libraries.

#### AMD SMI

AMD SMI for ROCm 6.1.1

##### Additions

* Added deferred error correctable counts to `amd-smi metric -ecc -ecc-blocks`.

##### Changes

* Updated the output of `amd-smi metric --ecc-blocks` to show counters available from blocks.
* Updated the output of `amd-smi metric --clock` to reflect each engine.
* Updated the output of `amd-smi topology --json` to align with output reported by host and guest systems.

##### Fixes

* Fixed `amd-smi metric --clock`'s clock lock status and deep sleep status.
* Fixed an issue that would cause an error when attempting to reset non-AMD GPUs.
* Fixed `amd-smi metric --pcie` and `amdsmi_get_pcie_info()` when using Navi 32 and Navi 31 hardware to prevent "UNKNOWN" reports.
* Fixed the output results of `amd-smi process` when getting processes running on a device.

##### Removals

* Removed the `amdsmi_get_gpu_process_info` API from the Python library. It was removed from the C library in an earlier release.

##### Known issues

* `amd-smi bad-pages` can result in a `ValueError: Null pointer access` error when using certain PMU firmware versions.

#### HIPCC

HIPCC for ROCm 6.1.1

##### Changes

* **Upcoming:** ROCm 6.2 will enable use of compiled binaries `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` by default. No action is needed by users; you may continue calling high-level Perl scripts `hipcc` and `hipconfig`. `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` will be invoked by the high-level Perl scripts. To revert to the previous behavior and invoke `hipcc.pl` and `hipconfig.pl`, set the `HIP_USE_PERL_SCRIPTS` environment variable to `1`.
* **Upcoming:** ROCm 6.3 will remove high-level Perl scripts `hipcc` and `hipconfig`. This release will remove the `HIP_USE_PERL_SCRIPTS` environment variable. It will rename `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` to `hipcc` and `hipconfig` respectively. No action is needed by the users. To revert to the previous behavior, invoke `hipcc.pl` and `hipconfig.pl` explicitly.
* **Upcoming:** ROCm 7.0 will remove `hipcc.pl` and `hipconfig.pl`.

#### HIPIFY

HIPIFY for ROCm 6.1.1

##### Additions

* Added support for LLVM 18.1.2.
* Added support for cuDNN 9.0.0.
* Added new option:
  * `--clang-resource-directory` to specify the clang resource path (the path to the parent folder for the `include` folder that contains `__clang_cuda_runtime_wrapper.h` and other header files used during the hipification process).
