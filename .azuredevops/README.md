# ROCm-CI Azure DevOps Pipelines

ROCm-CI Azure DevOps Pipelines contains markup language files that orchestrate build and test pipelines for ROCm components using [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/ROCm-CI/ROCm-CI/_build).

## Project Organization

- `/.azuredevops/variables-global.yml` - set of global variables accessible across any and all pipelines
  - protected keywords such as tokens and passwords are kept as secrets within the Azure DevOps project
- `/.azuredevops/components` - the sequence of templated steps for the job that checks out source, builds, packages, and runs tests for a ROCm repo
- `/.azuredevops/scheduled` - the sequence of templated steps for jobs that are schedule-based and not tied to a specific ROCm repo
- `/.azuredevops/tag-builds` - yml files to orchestrate manual builds based on specific tags (e.g., releases) without needing the corresponding yaml file in the component's repo
- `/.azuredevops/templates` - reusable yml files representing the templated steps that form the sequences in the above directories

### Per ROCm Repo

- `/.azuredevops/rocm-ci.yml` - contains the CI and PR trigger definitions associated with that repo, pointing to the corresponding yml file in the components folder in this central repository
